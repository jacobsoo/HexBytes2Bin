HexBytes2Bin
============

This is a simple script that i uses to create binary file(s) from hex bytes.
The hex bytes are usually what i've gotten from some maliious malware or from ExploitKit.
I need to convert it to binary files so that it's easier for me to analyse it.
I do hope that this will prove somewhat useful to some of you if not all of you.
